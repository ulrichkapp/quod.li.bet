# • quod.libet V0.1
### the slightly different URL-Shortener


**quod.libet** only saves the URL and a Hash (one-way-encrypted) to identify on recall.<br>**No personal data will be saved.**

**quod.libet** doesn't use neither AJAX nor a database-server.<br>
For saving the URLs and the Hash, it uses an SQLite database-file and it is written in PHP 8 (≥8.3 recommended).<br>
**As it is open source software, everybody can check the sources.**

… I'm aktually working on V0.2 It's still work in progress and the code here is not complete, sorry!

… Installation instructions coming soon.
